The math method is a very simple method which contains three parameters, two integers (num1 and num2) and a character (Operator).  The action of the math method is completely dependant on what Operator is. 

If Operator is a '+', num1 and num2 are added together and the method returns the summed value.

If Operator is a '-', num2 is subtracted from num1 and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '*', num1 and num 2 are multiplied together and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '/', num1 is divided by num2 and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '%', num1 is modulus divided by num2 and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '<', num1 will shift to the left num2 number of times and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '>', num1 will shift to the right num2 number of times and the value is returned.

If Operator is a '&', the method will return num1 AND num2.

If Operator is a '|', the method will return num1 OR num2.

If Operator is a '^', the method will return num1 XOR num2.

If Operator is a '~', the method with return the inverse of num1.

This is all tested in a simple main program which displays what the answer is and has a commented table of what each operator does.
